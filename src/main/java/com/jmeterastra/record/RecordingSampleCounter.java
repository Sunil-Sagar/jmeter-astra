 * This exists because {@code ProxyControl} delivers samplers asynchronously on proxy
 * threads. Re-pointing the recorder's target the instant the agent finishes a UI action
 * would misfile any request still in flight into the <em>next</em> business step. Waiting
 * for a quiet period before each boundary keeps step grouping honest.
 * <p>
 * Installed as a child of the recorder's {@code ProxyControl} node, which is how
