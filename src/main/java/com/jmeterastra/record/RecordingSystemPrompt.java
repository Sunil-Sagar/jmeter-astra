/**
 * Builds the system prompt for the recording agent.
 * <p>
 * The prompt's central job is to enforce <em>observe, act, observe</em>. The previous
 * Record Mode failed because it asked a model to emit a complete click-by-click plan
 * before the browser had even opened, so every selector was a guess. Here the model is
 * told, repeatedly and concretely, to take a snapshot and act only on what that snapshot
 * actually contains.
 * <p>
 * It also carries the safety rules that cannot be enforced structurally. Tool-level limits
 * (the {@code PlaywrightTools} allow-list) stop the agent doing things it must never do;
 * this covers the judgement calls, above all not completing real purchases.
