 * States for the JmeterAstra Record Mode session.

 * The former {@code FLUSHING_HAR}, {@code CONVERTING}, {@code LOADING} and
 * {@code CONVERT_PARTIAL} states belonged to the abandoned HAR-conversion design. With
 * JMeter's {@code ProxyControl} writing real samplers into the tree as traffic arrives,
 * there is no capture file to flush, convert or load: the plan is already built when
 * {@code EXECUTING} ends, so the session goes straight to correlation.
