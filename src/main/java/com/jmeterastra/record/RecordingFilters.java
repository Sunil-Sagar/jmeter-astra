     * {@code domain:port/path?query} - there is <strong>no scheme</strong>. A pattern
     * beginning {@code https?://} therefore matches nothing at all, and because
     * {@code ProxyControl} still notifies sample listeners for requests it excludes, the
     * failure is invisible: the sample count climbs into the thousands while every
     * Transaction Controller stays empty. That exact mistake shipped once already.
     * <p>
     * Two further {@code ProxyControl} behaviours matter. Matching uses ORO's
     * {@code Perl5Matcher.matches}, which requires the pattern to cover the <em>whole</em>
     * string, hence the trailing {@code (/.*)?} rather than an anchor at the host. And only
     * dots need escaping - every other character legal in a hostname is a regex literal.

     * still refusing a URL that merely mentions the host later on: a request to
     * {@code evil.com:80/?r=<host>} cannot match, because the prefix may not span the
     * {@code /}. The port group is optional purely for robustness; in practice
     * {@code generateMatchUrl} always emits one, falling back to the protocol default.
