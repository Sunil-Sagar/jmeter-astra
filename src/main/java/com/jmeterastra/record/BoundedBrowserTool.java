/**
 * Caps the size of a browser tool's output before it enters the conversation.
 * <p>
 * This exists because of an unbounded-growth failure that killed a real recording with
 * "prompt is too long: 3653143 tokens > 1000000 maximum". A Playwright MCP page snapshot
 * is an accessibility tree of the whole document, which on a content-heavy page runs to
 * hundreds of kilobytes. {@code ChatModel} implementations keep every turn and re-send the
 * whole history on each request, so an N-step recording re-sends N snapshots: cost grows
 * quadratically and the context window is exhausted long before a real scenario finishes.
 * <p>
 * Truncation is safe for the recording use case specifically. The model only needs enough
 * of the tree to choose the next element to interact with, and the recorded test plan is
 * built by JMeter's proxy from real traffic - nothing in the output depends on the model
 * having seen the entire page. The head of a snapshot is kept rather than the tail because
 * MCP emits page metadata and the interactive elements nearest the top first.
