/**
 * Owns one live recording: the scaffold being filled in and the proxy filling it.
 * <p>
 * Its whole job is the business-step boundary. Samplers are delivered to
 * {@code ProxyControl} asynchronously, so re-pointing the capture target the instant the
 * agent says "next step" would file still-in-flight requests under the wrong controller.
 * Every boundary therefore waits for the traffic to go quiet first.
 * <p>
 * The agent is treated as unreliable by design: it may begin a step without ending the
 * previous one, or name two steps identically. Those are normalised here rather than
 * rejected, because failing a tool call mid-recording costs a whole session while the
 * browser sits on a live page.
