/**
 * Turns the captured recording into a plan a user would actually keep: everything under the
 * Recording Controller is promoted into the Thread Group, and the emptied Recording
 * Controller is removed.
 * <p>
 * A Recording Controller is a capture target, not test structure. Leaving it in place would
 * ship the scaffolding with the deliverable - the same manual tidy-up every JMeter user does
 * by hand after recording. Promotion is done rather than recording straight into the Thread
 * Group because {@code ProxyControl} needs a single stable target node while traffic is
 * arriving, and the business-step Transaction Controllers are created underneath it.
 * <p>
 * This must run only after the proxy has stopped. The recorder's target points at nodes
 * inside this subtree, so reparenting them mid-capture would route later samplers into a
 * node that is no longer where the proxy believes it is.
