                + "   use ids exactly as returned by the read tools. They may change after add/move, so re-read if unsure.\n"
                + "3. To create something, call add_element with the parent_id and element_type; then configure it\n"
                + "   with update_element_property (e.g. HTTPSampler.path, HTTPSampler.domain).\n"

                + "   deleting an element that has children requires force=true (it removes the whole subtree).\n"
                + "5. Use toggle_element to enable/disable an element, and move_element to reparent one. Ids are\n"
                + "   tree paths, so an element's id changes after it moves - re-read with get_tree_state before reusing it.\n"
                + "6. Respect the element hierarchy below: only add an element under a valid parent.\n"
                + "7. Make one logical change at a time and use read tools to verify before moving on.\n"
