/**
 * Holds the most recent {@code find_correlation_candidates} result so a later
 * {@code apply_correlation} call - in the same or a later chat turn - can reference a
 * finding by its 1-based id, without the agent needing to round-trip full candidate
 * details back through tool arguments.
 * <p>
 * Static/process-wide by design: a JMeter GUI process only ever has one active test
 * plan, and {@code AgentToolRegistry.createDefault()} constructs a fresh
 * {@code FindCorrelationCandidatesHandler}/{@code ApplyCorrelationHandler} pair on every
 * agent turn, so per-instance state would not be shared between "find" and a later
 * "apply" call. This mirrors the same static-state pattern already used by
 * {@code CorrelationEngine.Collector}/{@code Ender} and {@code TestPlanRunner}'s
 * {@code SampleCollector}/{@code RunEndedListener} in this codebase.
